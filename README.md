This was made possible thanks to the integration of USDt into The Open Network, announced by Telegram CEO Pavel Durov and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino at the TOKEN2049 conference in Dubai.
To celebrate the launch of USDt-TON, all USDt withdrawals to external TON wallets will be free until the end of June.

Telegram wallet users can now send tokens and digital collectibles (NFTs) from TON Space directly to their contacts.

You can transfer any token on the TON blockchain without entering an address - just select a contact and TON Space will handle the rest.

In Telegram chats, the ability to send USDt to your interlocutor was introduced. Now you can send and receive them directly on Telegram, as easy as sending a message. Instant and free.
